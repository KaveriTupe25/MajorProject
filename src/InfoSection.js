      <h1>Understanding Insulin</h1>
      <p>
        Insulin is a vital hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. It helps 
        the body use glucose from carbohydrates in the food for energy or store 
        glucose for future use. People with diabetes might need insulin therapy 
        to help maintain blood sugar levels within a target range.

      <h2>Why Use a Smart Insulin Calculator?</h2>
      <p>
        Managing insulin dosage is crucial to avoid the risks of hyperglycemia 
        or hypoglycemia. A Smart Insulin Calculator helps calculate accurate 
        insulin doses based on carbohydrate intake and other factors, ensuring 
        optimal glucose control.
